 Basic Rule-Based Chatbot (Task 4)
📌 Goal
To build a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs using predefined rules and basic natural language processing techniques.

🛠️ Scope & Features
Accepts user inputs like:

"hello", "how are you", "bye", etc.

Gives predefined replies such as:

"Hi!", "I'm fine, thanks!", "Goodbye!", etc.

Uses key programming concepts:

functions, if-elif, loops, dictionary, and string processing.

💡 Key Concepts Used
Functions: For modular and reusable code.

Loops: To continuously interact until the user exits.

Conditional Statements: To handle different user inputs using if-elif-else.

Dictionaries & Tuples: For managing multiple input variations with clean, scalable code.

String Processing: Input normalization using lowercase, punctuation removal, and trimming.

🧾 How It Works
The chatbot greets the user and waits for input.

Input is preprocessed (converted to lowercase, stripped of punctuation).

It checks the input against predefined rules.

Responds accordingly or says "I don't understand that."

Loop exits when the user types "bye", "goodbye", or "see you".# CodeAlpha_Basic-Chatbot1
